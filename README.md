# Twelve Tone Grid Calculator for Serialism in Music Theory

# Overview
This program takes in a twelve tone row from the user, in integer format where C = 0 up through B = e, in a single string and with the proper offset provided by the user, will generate the associated grid in note name notation, with all enharmonics defaulting to their flat naming, (F# is only every presented as Gb).

I wrote this program in part because the algorithm for the creation of the grid seemed straightforward, but also to practice creating and manipulating multi-dimensional arrays, specifically a list of strings in this instance.

# Development Environment
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.9.5 64bit
* Windows 11

# Future Work
I want to expand upon this program to make it more user friendly by rewriting it in JavaScript with a html page to make a small web application version, a type of program I have not done before.
